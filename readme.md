# Hangman JS

## Your Task

Recreate the classic game of Hangman! Your version, however, will exist entirely in the Javascript console and/or in alert boxes.

Here's a [refresher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)) on how the game works. You can approach this however you'd like. If you need help, we've included a few hints [here](https://github.com/ga-wdi-exercises/hangman-lab/blob/master/hints.md).
